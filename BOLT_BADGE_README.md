2. Badge is properly implemented in the HTML and CSS
3. Links are correctly configured
4. Responsive design is implemented
5. No conflicts with existing game UI elements

## How to Switch Badge Variations

### To use the black circle badge:
Change the image source in `index.html`:
```html
<img src="/black_circle_360x360.png" alt="Built with Bolt.new" />
```

### To use the text-only badge:
1. Change the CSS class in `index.html`:
```html
<div id="boltBadge" class="bolt-badge-text">
```

2. Change the image source:
```html
<img src="/logotext_poweredby_360w.png" alt="Built with Bolt.new" />
```

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: Badge uses optimized PNG images
- **Efficient**: CSS animations use hardware acceleration
- **Fast**: No JavaScript required for badge functionality
